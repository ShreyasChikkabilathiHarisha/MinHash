===============
Midway:
--------
1) Prepared demo for midway result (basicworkflow.cpp) - to estimate jaccard index based on containment min hash approach, calculate true jaccard index and figure out relative error.
Final Demo:
-----------
1) Bug fixing on intial code written by Shreyas
2) Rewrote MinHash code for improving efficiency 
3) Added required functions in MinHash and unit tested them
4) Containment MinHash implementation and testing
5) Implemented basicWorkflow to calculate true jaccard, min hash and containment hash based estimation of jaccard index and relative error
6) Identified apt bloom filters, murmurhash, hd5 and other libraries and tested their functionalites  
7) Generated simulated long reads using the same function provided in the containment hash repository
8) Minhash index building in c++ for all virus files - takes about 8 mins (c++) compared to 40 mins (python)


Shreyas:
========
1) Initial code for MinHash
2) Initial mapper.c
