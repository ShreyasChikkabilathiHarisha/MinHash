===============
Midway:
-----------
1) Prepared demo for midway result (basicworkflow.cpp) - to estimate jaccard index based on containment min hash approach, calculate true jaccard index by all kmers comparions and list out relative error.
Final Demo:
----------------
1) Bug fixing on initial Minhash code written by Shreyas
2) Rewrote almost all of MinHash code for correctness and improving efficiency
3) Added required functions in MinHash and unit tested them
4) Containment MinHash implementation and testing
5) Implemented basicWorkflow to calculate true jaccard index, min hash and containment hash based estimation of jaccard index and listing out relative errors.
6) Identified/Wrote suitable fastq reader, bloom filters, murmurhash, hd5 and other tools/libraries and tested their functionalites.
7) Generated simulated long reads using the same python code provided in the containment hash repository to be used for comparing results after all working C++ code is ready.( Considerable work was required to install all required tools and setting up the environment).


Shreyas:
========
1) Code for MinHash
2) Mapper.c
3) minhash calculation in the basickWorkflow.cpp file.
4) code cleanup
5) instructions


Sourav:
=======
1. Worked on the midway report and demo.
2. Read minhash sketches and kmers and generate jaccard.
3. Worked on mapper.c
4. Made changes to BasicWorkflow.cpp before final result generation.
5. Generated the final results including the result present in the report.
6. Worked on generating the final report.
