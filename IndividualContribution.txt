===============
Midway:
--------
1) Prepared demo for midway result (basicworkflow.cpp) - to estimate jaccard index based on containment min hash approach, calculate true jaccard index and figure out relative error.
Final Demo:
-----------
1) Bug fixing on intial code written by Shreyas
2) Rewrote MinHash code for improving efficiency
3) Added required functions in MinHash and unit tested them
4) Containment MinHash implementation and testing
5) Implemented basicWorkflow to calculate true jaccard, min hash and containment hash based estimation of jaccard index and relative error
6) Identified apt bloom filters, murmurhash, hd5 and other libraries and tested their functionalites
7) Generated simulated long reads using the same function provided in the containment hash repository
8) Minhash index building in c++ for all virus files - takes about 8 mins (c++) compared to 40 mins (python)


Shreyas:
========
1) Code for MinHash
2) Mapper.c
3) minhash calculation in the basickWorkflow.cpp file.
4) code cleanup
5) instructions


Sourav:
=======
1. Worked on the midway report and demo.
2. Read minhash sketches and kmers and generate jaccard.
3. Worked on mapper.c
4. Made changes to BasicWorkflow.cpp before final result generation.
5. Generated the final results including the result present in the report.
6. Worked on generating the final report.
